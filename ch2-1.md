Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science
and engineering. However, because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather
than discrete mathematics, many computer scientists have little experience with it.
A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working
with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms. We
therefore precede our introduction to deep learning with a focused presentation of
the key linear algebra prerequisites.
If you are already familiar with linear algebra, feel free to skip this chapter. If
you have previous experience with these concepts but need a detailed reference
sheet to review key formulas, we recommend The Matrix Cookbook (Petersen and
Pedersen, 2006). If you have no exposure at all to linear algebra, this chapter
will teach you enough to read this book, but we highly recommend that you also
consult another resource focused exclusively on teaching linear algebra, such as
Shilov (1977). This chapter will completely omit many important linear algebra
topics that are not essential for understanding deep learning.
