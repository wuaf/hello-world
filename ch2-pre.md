Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering. However, because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics, many computer scientists have little experience with it. A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms. We therefore precede our introduction to deep learning with a focused presentation of the key linear algebra prerequisites. If you are already familiar with linear algebra, feel free to skip this chapter. If you have previous experience with these concepts but need a detailed reference sheet to review key formulas, we recommend The Matrix Cookbook (Petersen and Pedersen, 2006). If you have no exposure at all to linear algebra, this chapter will teach you enough to read this book, but we highly recommend that you also consult another resource focused exclusively on teaching linear algebra, such as Shilov (1977). This chapter will completely omit many important linear algebra topics that are not essential for understanding deep learning.

线性代数是在科学和工程领域广泛应用的一个数学分支。 然而由于线性代数是具有连续而非离散性质的数学， 很多计算机科学家在这方面的经验较少。 熟练掌握线性代数对于理解和运用许多机器学习算法，特别是深度 学习算法，是必要的。 所以我们在继续介绍深度学习之前先集中介绍线性代数的一些关键知识。

如果你对线性代数已经很熟悉，可以选择跳过此章。如果你使用过相关概念但是需要一个详细的参考手册来回顾关键公式， 我们推荐《The Matrix Cookbook》（Peterson 安定 Pedersen， 2006）。如果你从来没接触过线性代数，本章提供给你足够 的知识来阅读本书，但是我们推荐你找一本专门教授线性代数的教材研读，如Shilov（1977）。 本章将忽略掉很多线性代数中和理解深度学习无关的主题。
